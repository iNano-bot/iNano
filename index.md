## Welcome to iNano project

Hello everybody, iNano here starting this new project. I'm really new to infosec and pentesting and i'm wishing to improve by sharing my experience with all of you.
So pls, be kind and don't pick on me if you're looking for something pro, i'm just a n00b pretending to master the thing.

### First Thing First

within this repo, i'm going to upload writeups and little footsteps i'll do in my path to success, willing to learn as much as i can in the meanwhile. Trying to be professional but, again, i'm new to this so i don't think i'll be. If you don't bother helping, just nudge me with some advice. No shitstorming, guys, be gentle.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/iNano-bot/iNano/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
